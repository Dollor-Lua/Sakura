# Sakura

> Open sourced programming language written in C

An open sourced programming language created as a learning tool to better understand the world of binary interpreted languages. The goal of Sakura is to create a language that can both interpret its base language (the one you should use) and an assembly version of it, which is the binary instructions but also slightly more readable. The basis/primary inspiration is Lua, a simplistic programming language that actually has a lot going on internally (try luac -l [script-name]), including a binary format that can be interpreted as a sort of assembly.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Turing complete
- [ ] Convenient to use
- [ ] Self hosted (written in itself)

## Installation

Sakura is currently incomplete, so there are no built releases. If you wish to use Sakura in it's current state, you can clone the repository and build it using make.

## Usage Examples

Coming soon... but heres this:

```
print(1 + 2 * 3);
```

## Documentation

Will be provided when the language is at a "finished" state, so maybe around the time it becomes convenient to use?

## Contributing

Below still applies BUT, if you provide some decent code, especially for something I don't want to do, I will accept the pull request.

Currently, I am not accepting contributions. As this is a learning experience I will not intentionally push bugged versions to github, rather only versions which are "working". In the future when the project is mostly complete, I will accept pull requests to fix unnoticed bugs or to help with getting the language from the partial completion state (after the "learning experience" stuff) to a convenient to use language (something that could be preferred over Lua (or Javascript) for example).

You can report bugs in the issues tab of github, but I won't accept any pull requests at the moment.

There is currently no bug report format, but please make it logical.
