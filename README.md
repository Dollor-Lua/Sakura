# Sakura

An open sourced programming language created as a learning tool to better understand the world of binary interpreted languages. The goal of Sakura is to create a language that can both interpret its base language (the one you should use) and an assembly version of it, which is the binary instructios but slightly more readable.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Turing complete
- [ ] Convenient to use
- [ ] Self hosted (written in itself)
- [ ] Optimized
- [ ] Fully compiled version of the assembly?

## Contributing

You cannot contribute at the moment whilst this language is still being written. Please be patient for me to finish making it, and then I will accept contributions.

Of course, if you would like to fix a bug for me I will (may) accept the pull request, but thihs is primarily for my own learning experience.

## License

Sakura is licensed under the MIT license, see license.txt for more information.
